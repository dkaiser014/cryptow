Look at the current and updated price of the top cryptocurrencies ATM!

## Â¿Why?

Often times I find myself looking at [investing.com](https://investing.com/crypto) top cryptocurrency list to view
the current and updated prices, and well, that takes time and I like to be as efficient as possible, so having a program that
I'm able to run from my terminal that list all cryptos and their prices it's incredibly relaxing.

## TODO's

- [x] Do an API request to the [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com)
- [x] List all the cryptocurrencies.
- [ ] Refactor and improve the `main.go` file.
- [ ] Print the cryptos with their prices below or at the side.
- [ ] Add colors to the prices.
